# ShotStat üèÄ
<hr>

This is an app that can be used for basketball score keeping. 
The app allows the user to update a home or away teams points in increments of one, two or three. 

The app allows the user to reset the game, which will clear both scores and be ready for a new game. 
If the user wishes to keep track of scores they can save the game using the save game button. 
This will then display a table at the bottom of the screen and display the home teams score, the 
away teams score as well as an outcome message declaring the winner with a message and and emoji or stating that the round was a draw. 

For every further game if the user desires to save, a new row will be entered in the table with the games outcomes. 
The table for scores will remain hidden until the user saves their first game. 

This project allowed me to learn more on HTML tables and how they could be updated using JS.
I also was able to practice added a single event listener to a div to control all three of the add score buttons for the home and away team,
reducing the amount of event listeners in the code. 

The app can be viewed for live demo here - <a href="https://shotstat.netlify.app/">ShotStat</a>
